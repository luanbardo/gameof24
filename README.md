# gameof24

Simple game of 24 I made for an interview. It accepts any goal besides 24 but can only work with 4 numbers, and doesnt have any exceptions handlers for user input errors.
"A game of 24 is an arithmetical puzzle in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24."
